## Understanding Stress and Anxiety 
Many of us and our friends may be facing stress and trauma because of the pandemic. 
Whether you are a sick person, caring for one, facing loss of family or just feel helpless hearing the news of loss around you – COVID-19 can affect your mental health in multiple ways. 

Make sure to check on your friends and ensure they are healthy mentally during this time. This would be applicable specifically of older people in your family, domestic staff, and those less privileged who often brush off these problems. 

Caring for your mental health and of those around you can help you become more resilient. 
Taking care of yourself can also help you care better for others.

### Stress can manifest in the following ways
From [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html)

  > 1. Feelings of fear, anger, sadness, worry, numbness, or frustration.
  > 2. Changes in appetite, energy, desires, and interests.
  > 3. Difficulty concentrating and making decisions.
  > 4. Difficulty sleeping or nightmares.
  > 5. Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, and skin rashes.
  > 6. Worsening of chronic health problems.
